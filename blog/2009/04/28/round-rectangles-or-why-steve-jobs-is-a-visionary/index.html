<div class="entry-content"><p>A story was posted on <a href="http://www.folklore.org">Folklore.org</a> (a site full of old stories about the creation and initial development of Apple computers) about <a href="http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium&amp;search=round%20rect">the addition of rounded rectangles to an old drawing program</a>, and Steve Jobs&#8217;s involvement in them. This section in particular struck me:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bill fired up his demo and it quickly filled the Lisa screen with randomly-sized ovals, faster than you thought was possible. But something was bothering Steve Jobs. &#8220;Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners? Can we do that now, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s no way to do that. In fact it would be really hard to do, and I don&#8217;t think we really need it&#8221;. I think Bill was a little miffed that Steve wasn&#8217;t raving over the fast ovals and still wanted more.</p>

<p>Steve suddenly got more intense. &#8220;Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!&#8221;. And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables. Then he pointed out the window. &#8220;And look outside, there&#8217;s even more, practically everywhere you look!&#8221;. He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find.</p>

<p>When Steve and Bill passed a no-parking sign with rounded corners, it did the trick. &#8220;OK, I give up&#8221;, Bill pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s as hard as I thought.&#8221; He went back home to work on it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think this is a fantastic example of what makes Steve Jobs one of the few true visionaries in the world. In the face of a big advancement like fast ovals (yes, it was definitely a big deal at the time), I would&#8217;ve been more than satisfied. I may have asked for rounded rectangles in a second iteration, but it would&#8217;ve been a simple feature idea.  I believe most people would&#8217;ve reacted the same way.</p>

<p>What makes Steve Jobs special is his ability to quickly identify what&#8217;s really important. It seems so obvious after the fact. Of course people would like computers with translucent colored cases! Of course minimalist controls would make for a more accessible and desirable MP3 player! Of course rounded rectangles are an extremely common shape, and are really important to have in a drawing program! These ideas (and more) are all obvious now. But a year before Apple did them, other companies were struggling to innovate in these fields, and they were only &#8220;obvious&#8221; to Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>Of course, anyone can have a great idea that turns out to be the right way of doing things. This is why I distinguish between &#8220;true&#8221; and regular (false?) visionaries. People called M. Night Shyamalan a visionary after &#8220;The Sixth Sense&#8221; and &#8220;Unbreakable&#8221;. He then went on to make one more pretty good but decidedly un-visionary movie (Signs), an arguably good but decidedly un-visionary movie (The Village, which I loved, but I understand why others didn&#8217;t), and two duds (my apologies to the three people who liked them). The visionary label was applied to Shyamalan before he&#8217;d reached first base, and he got thrown out at second. This happens all the time, and these people are certainly not true visionaries.</p>

<p>True visionaries come up with visionary ideas so consistently, that it becomes expected of them. And no one (off the top of my head) has a more consistent history of this than Steve Jobs.</p>
