Last night, I spent two hours trying to get PHP (a programming language) working on my Mac. Eventually, I realized it had been working for about an hour and fifty minutes of the time, but Firefox had cached the error page.  Once I cleared my cache, everything was fine.  Did I hate my computer for wasting my time?  No, I felt a sense of accomplishment from finally solving the problem.

Today, I spent another two hours trying to fix the problems with this blog and get it back online.  I went through about 25 poorly-written articles on various aspects of the problem (integration between PHP, nginx, FastCGI, and lighttpd, in case you're interested). I also struggled with prewritten scripts containing awful formatting errors, such as replacing the " (double-quote) symbol with '' (two apostrophes), forcing me to hunt down these errors.  Eventually, I figured out the problem, fixed all the scripts, and got it working (as you can see).  Did I feel a sense of frustration from the poor documentation?  No, I felt a sense of self-satisfaction from solving the problem, figuring it out (virtually) myself, and learning something new in the process

From what I understand, these are the things that make many people swear off programming or any complicated computer work; if it takes too much effort to deduce and fix the problem, it's too frustrating for many people.  I have no problem with this, and in fact, I feel it in many other areas.  But for some reason, it's the opposite for me.  The longer I have to spend on something, the better I feel when I finally fix it (except for the rare exception where it was a stupid mistake on my part, in which case I feel annoyed with myself, not with the concept of computers).

I have a feeling that this is true for many people in my field.  It's the difference between the person who goes "I *tried* to learn programming, but you have to get *everything* right! If you get one little thing wrong, the whole thing breaks!" and the person (like me) who gleefully recounts a late-night six-hour debugging session like it was the most exhilarating thing to happen in a long time.

I don't think either of these things are "right" or "wrong", but I do think one of them is more indicative of some sort of mental illness, and I don't think it bodes well for me.
