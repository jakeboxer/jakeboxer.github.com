Every single holiday since I can remember, my mom has made a dish called [Lokshen Kugel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokshen_kugel). She makes it with egg noodles, cottage cheese, sour cream, and a bunch of sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon (as well as the standard eggs and stuff).

Today, after getting the recipe from her, I made it myself.  The weirdest feeling was opening the oven halfway through. There was a dish I'd seen dozens of times before, but for the first time, it wasn't in the oven at my house (the one I grew up in), and it was made by me instead of my mom. It was very surreal.

I haven't tasted it yet. But when I do, I'll post about it again. I also took some pictures, so I'll be sure to put them up (once I find the cord for my camera).
